summary: Poster presentation
abstract: Humans achieve their goals in joint action tasks either by cooperation or competition. Here, we investigated the neural processes underpinning error and monetary rewards processing in such cooperative and competitive situations.  We used electroencephalography and analyzed event-related potentials. 26 dyads performed a joint four-alternative forced choice task. Participants received performance feedback about their individual and joint errors and accompanying monetary rewards.We used linear mixed effects models to analyze the feedback-related-negativity (FRN) and used the Threshold-free cluster enhancement (TFCE) method to explore activations of all electrodes and times. We found main effects of the outcome and social situation, but no interaction at mid-line frontal electrodes. The FRN was more negative for losses than wins in both social situations. Moreover, the FRN amplitudes differed between social situations. Further, the differences induced by the social situations were stronger in participants with higher scores on a perspective taking test. Our exploratory TFCE analysis revealed that processing of feedback differs between cooperative and competitive situations at right temporo-parietal electrodes. In sum, our results replicate previous studies about the FRN and extend them by comparing neurophysiological responses to positive and negative outcomes in a task that simultaneously engages two participants in competitive and cooperative situations.
