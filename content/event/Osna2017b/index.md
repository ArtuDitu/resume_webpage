title: Does the social situations affect how we process feedback about our actions?

summary: Poster presentation
abstract: People performing joint actions usually cooperate or compete to achieve their goals. Little research has investigated the neural processes underpinning error and reward processing in cooperative and competitive situations. In the present study, we investigated event-related potentials (ERPs) elicited by feedback (i.e., the feedback-related negativity (FRN)) denoting individual and joint errors as well as positive, negative or no monetary rewards in cooperative and competitive situations. Twelve pairs (N=24) of participants performed a joint four-alternative forced choice (4AFC) memory task. At the end of each trial, participants received feedback related to both their individual performances and monetary rewards. Note, the monetary rewards were dependent on the social situation (i.e., cooperative or competitive). Preliminary results suggest that the FRN is not error-specific but instead reward-specific and it is also present after a neutral outcome (i.e., no monetary reward). Moreover, cluster permutation analysis of EEG data revealed differences in error processing between cooperative and competitive situations. Taken together, our results suggest that the FRN is influenced by different monetary rewards (i.e., positive, negative or no monetary reward) and more generally, that neural processing of feedback differs in cooperative and competitive situations.
