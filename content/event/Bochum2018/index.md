summary: Poster presentation
abstract: 'People performing joint actions may cooperate or compete to achieve their joint or individual goals. In the present study, we investigated the neural processes underpinning error and monetary rewards processing in such situations using the EEG. We analyzed event-related potentials (ERPs) triggered by feedback about individual and joint actions in cooperative and competitive situations. Given previous literature, we hypothesized monetary losses will elicit more negative responses at midline frontal electrodes (Feedback Related Negativity (FRN)) than monetary wins without regard to the social situation. Additionally, we expected that processing of feedback might be modulated by the social situation (cooperative and competitive).	Twenty pairs (N=50) of participants performed a joint four-alternative forced choice (4AFC) visual task either cooperatively or competitively. At the end of each trial, participants received visual performance feedback and accompanying monetary rewards. Specifically, the feedback included individual and joint errors. Furthermore, the resulting positive, negative or neutral monetary rewards were dependent on the social situation. This design rigorously instructed participant to cooperate or compete due to the pay-off matrix. We used linear mixed effects analyses to study the FRN. Analysis of the EEG data revealed the main effect of the valence of the outcome at midline frontal electrodes. The FRN was more negative for losses than wins in both social situations. Moreover, our results suggest that the FRN might be modulated by different social situations. Additionally, we used Threshold Free Cluster Enhancement (TFCE) and permutation tests to explore the data. Results of these analyses suggest the same effect of modulation in processing of feedback between cooperative and competative sitations. In sum, our results replicate previous studies about the FRN and extend them by comparing neurophysiological responses to positive and negative outcomes in a competitive situation, which simultaneously engage two participants.  Furthermore, the present design allows for within participants comparison between different social situations (cooperative and competitive). Results of this comparison suggest that the FRN is modulated by social situations. These results can shed new light on the neural process underpinning error and reward processing in cooperative and competitive situations.'
