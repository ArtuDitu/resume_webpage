summary: Poster presentation
abstract: People performing joint actions usually cooperate or compete to achieve their goals. Little research has investigated the neural processes underpinning error and reward processing in cooperative and competitive situations. In the present study, we focused on developing a new paradigm to investigate interactions between physiological signals as measured by EEG and monetary rewards in cooperative and competitive situations. Twelve pairs (N=24) of participants performed a joint four-alternative forced choice memory task. At the end of each trial, participants received visual feedback related to both their individual performances and monetary rewards. Note, the monetary rewards were dependent on the social situation, i.e. cooperative or competitive. The comparison of the feedback-related negativity in cooperative and competitive situations for own and joint performance relates allows the investigation of the physiological basis for interactions in these social situations. Specifically, the behavioral results of the task analysis suggested that newly designed experiment is suitable to investigate the feedback-related negativity. Furthermore, our preliminary experimental results suggested that the feedback-related negativity is not error-specific but instead reward-specific and it is also present after a neutral outcome with no monetary reward. Moreover, cluster permutation analysis of EEG data revealed significant differences in error processing between cooperative and competitive situations. Taken together, our results suggest that the feedback-related negativity is influenced by different monetary rewards and more generally, that neural processing of feedback differs in cooperative and competitive situations.
