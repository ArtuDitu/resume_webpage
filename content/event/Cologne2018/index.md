summary: Poster presentation
abstract: People performing joint actions may cooperate or compete to achieve their joint or individual goals. In the present study, we investigated the neural processes underpinning error and monetary rewards processing in such situations using EEG. We analyzed event-related potentials (ERPs) triggered by feedback about individual and joint actions in cooperative and competitive situations. Twenty pairs (N=40) of participants performed a joint four-alternative forced choice (4AFC) visual task either cooperatively or competitively (factor social situation). At the end of each trial, participants received visual performance feedback and monetary rewards. Specifically, the feedback included individual and joint errors.  Furthermore, the resulting positive, negative or neutral monetary rewards were dependent on the social situation. A threshold free cluster analysis of EEG data revealed two significant clusters. We found that there is a main effect of the valence of the outcome around 220 milliseconds after the feedback presentation at midline frontal electrodes. This cluster (FRN) was more negative for losses than wins in both social situations. Moreover, we found that there is a main effect of the social situation around 120 milliseconds after the feedback presentation at centro-temporal (left) electrodes. This cluster was more positive for the competitive than for the cooperative situation. In sum, our results replicate previous studies about FRN and extend them by comparing neurophysiological responses to positive and negative outcomes in a competitive situation, which simultaneously engage two participants. Moreover, our results that human first process the information about the social situation and then evaluate the outcome.
