summary: Poster presentation
abstract: People performing joint actions usually cooperate or compete to achieve their joint or individual goals. In the present study, we focused on developing a paradigm investigating interactions between neurophysiological signals as measured by EEG and monetary rewards in cooperative and competitive situations. We investigated the feedback-related negativity (FRN) and the f-P300 event-related potentials elicited by feedback. Twenty pairs (N=40) of participants performed a joint four-alternative forced choice (4AFC) memory task. At the end of each trial, participants received visual feedback related to both their individual performances and the resulting monetary rewards. The feedback included individual and joint errors as well as the resulting positive, negative or neutral monetary rewards. Note, the schema of monetary rewards were dependent on the social situation, i.e., cooperative or competitive. Our preliminary results suggest that the FRN is a generic component evaluating the outcome of an action but it is not modulated by the social situation. However, f-P300, component following FRN is strongly affected by the social situation. Namely, the feedback about our actions in competitive situation elicits significantly more positive ERP responses than in cooperative situation. Moreover, response times in competitive situation are faster than in cooperative situation. Taken together, our results suggest that the behavioral (response times) and neurophysiological (f-P300) measures are modulated by social situations. Furthermore, the FRN component is strictly dependent on the action outcome but it is not modulated by social situations. These results can shed new light on the neural process underpinning reward processing in cooperative and competitive situations.
