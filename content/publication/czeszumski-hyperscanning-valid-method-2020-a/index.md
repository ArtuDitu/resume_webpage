abstract: Social interactions are a crucial part of human life. Understanding the
  neural underpinnings of social interactions is a challenging task that the hyperscanning
  method has been trying to tackle over the last two decades. Here, we review the
  existing literature and evaluate the current state of the hyperscanning method.
  We review the type of methods (fMRI, M/EEG, and fNIRS) that are used to measure
  brain activity from more than one participant simultaneously and weigh their pros
  and cons for hyperscanning. Further, we discuss different types of analyses that
  are used to estimate brain networks and synchronization. Lastly, we present results
  of hyperscanning studies in the context of different cognitive functions and their
  relations to social interactions. All in all, we aim to comprehensively present
  methods, analyses, and results from the last 20 years of hyperscanning research.
