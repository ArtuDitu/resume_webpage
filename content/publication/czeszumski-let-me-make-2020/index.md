abstract: The embodied approach of human cognition suggests that concepts are deeply
  dependent upon and constrained by an agent's physical body's characteristics, such
  as performed body movements. In this study, we attempted to broaden previous research
  on emotional priming, investigating the interaction of emotions and visual exploration.
  We used the joystick-based approach-avoidance task to influence the emotional states
  of participants, and subsequently, we presented pictures of news web pages on a
  computer screen and measured participant's eye movements. As a result, the number
  of fixations on images increased, the total dwell time increased, and the average
  saccade length from outside of the images towards the images decreased after the
  bodily congruent priming phase. The combination of these effects suggests increased
  attention to web pages' image content after the participants performed bodily congruent
  actions in the priming phase. Thus, congruent bodily interaction with images in
  the priming phase fosters visual interaction in the subsequent exploration phase.
