abstract: Humans achieve their goals in joint action tasks either by cooperation or
  competition. In the present study, we investigated the neural processes underpinning
  error and monetary rewards processing in such cooperative and competitive situations.
  We used electroencephalography (EEG) and analyzed event-related potentials (ERPs)
  triggered by feedback in both social situations. 26 dyads performed a joint four-alternative
  forced choice (4AFC) visual task either cooperatively or competitively. At the end
  of each trial, participants received performance feedback about their individual
  and joint errors and accompanying monetary rewards. Furthermore, the outcome, i.e.,
  resulting positive, negative, or neutral rewards, was dependent on the pay-off matrix,
  defining the social situation either as cooperative or competitive. We used linear
  mixed effects models to analyze the feedback-related-negativity (FRN) and used the
  Threshold-free cluster enhancement (TFCE) method to explore activations of all electrodes
  and times. We found main effects of the outcome and social situation, but no interaction
  at mid-line frontal electrodes. The FRN was more negative for losses than wins in
  both social situations. However, the FRN amplitudes differed between social situations.
  Moreover, we compared monetary with neutral outcomes in both social situations.
  Our exploratory TFCE analysis revealed that processing of feedback differs between
  cooperative and competitive situations at right temporo-parietal electrodes where
  the cooperative situation elicited more positive amplitudes. Further, the differences
  induced by the social situations were stronger in participants with higher scores
  on a perspective taking test. In sum, our results replicate previous studies about
  the FRN and extend them by comparing neurophysiological responses to positive and
  negative outcomes in a task that simultaneously engages two participants in competitive
  and cooperative situations.
