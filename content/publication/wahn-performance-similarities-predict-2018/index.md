abstract: When humans perform tasks together, they may reach a higher performance
  in comparison to the best member of a group (i.e., a collective benefit). Earlier
  research showed that interindividual performance similarities predict collective
  benefits for several joint tasks. Yet, researchers did not test whether this is
  the case for joint visuospatial tasks. Also, researchers did not investigate whether
  dyads and triads reach a collective benefit when they are forbidden to exchange
  any information while performing a visuospatial task. In this study, participants
  performed a joint visual search task either alone, in dyads, or in triads, and were
  not allowed to exchange any information while doing the task. We found that dyads
  reached a collective benefit. Triads did outperform their best individual member
  and dyads— yet, they did not outperform the best dyad pairing within the triad.
  In addition, similarities in performance significantly predicted the collective
  benefit for dyads and triads. Furthermore, we find that the dyads' and triads' search
  performances closely match a simulated performance based on the individual search
  performances, which assumed that members of a group act independently. Overall,
  the present study supports the view that performance similarities predict collective
  benefits in joint tasks. Moreover, it provides a basis for future studies to investigate
  the benefits of exchanging information between co-actors in joint visual search
  tasks.
