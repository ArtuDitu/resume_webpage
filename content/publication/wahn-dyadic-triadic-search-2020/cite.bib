 abstract = {In daily life, humans often perform visual tasks, such as solving puzzles or searching for a friend in a crowd. Performing these visual searches jointly with a partner can be beneficial: The two task partners can devise effective division of labor strategies and thereby outperform individuals who search alone. To date, it is unknown whether these group benefits scale up to triads or whether the cost of coordinating with others offsets any potential benefit for group sizes above two. To address this question, we compare participants' performance in a visual search task that they perform either alone, in dyads, or in triads. When the search task is performed jointly, co-actors receive information about each other's gaze location. After controlling for speed– accuracy trade-offs, we found that triads searched faster than dyads, suggesting that group benefits do scale up to triads. Moreover, we found that the triads' divided the search space in accordance with the co-actors' individual search performances but searched less efficiently than dyads. We also present a linear model to predict group benefits, which accounts for 70% of the variance. The model includes our experimental factors and a set of non-redundant predictors, quantifying the similarities in the individual performances, the collaboration between co-actors, and the estimated benefits that co-actors would attain without collaborating. Overall, the present study demonstrates that group benefits scale up to larger group sizes, but the additional gains are attenuated by the increased costs associated with devising effective division of labor strategies.},
