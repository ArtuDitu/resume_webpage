abstract: "In daily life, humans often perform visual tasks, such as solving puzzles\
  \ or searching for a friend in a crowd. Performing these visual searches jointly\
  \ with a partner can be beneficial: The two task partners can devise effective division\
  \ of labor strategies and thereby outperform individuals who search alone. To date,\
  \ it is unknown whether these group benefits scale up to triads or whether the cost\
  \ of coordinating with others offsets any potential benefit for group sizes above\
  \ two. To address this question, we compare participants' performance in a visual\
  \ search task that they perform either alone, in dyads, or in triads. When the search\
  \ task is performed jointly, co-actors receive information about each other's gaze\
  \ location. After controlling for speed– accuracy trade-offs, we found that triads\
  \ searched faster than dyads, suggesting that group benefits do scale up to triads.\
  \ Moreover, we found that the triads' divided the search space in accordance with\
  \ the co-actors' individual search performances but searched less efficiently than\
  \ dyads. We also present a linear model to predict group benefits, which accounts\
  \ for 70% of the variance. The model includes our experimental factors and a set\
  \ of non-redundant predictors, quantifying the similarities in the individual performances,\
  \ the collaboration between co-actors, and the estimated benefits that co-actors\
  \ would attain without collaborating. Overall, the present study demonstrates that\
  \ group benefits scale up to larger group sizes, but the additional gains are attenuated\
  \ by the increased costs associated with devising effective division of labor strategies."
